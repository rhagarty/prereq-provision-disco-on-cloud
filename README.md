**IMPORTANT**: Take note of the `Credentials` values. They will be required if you want to access the service using the API. If you need to create a new set of credentials, click on the `Service Credentials` tab option.

Click the `Launch Watson Discovery` button to navigate to your service.

The Watson Discovery service allows you to create `Collections` of data. Once created, you will need to know the `Environment`, `Configuration` and `Collection` IDs to access your service using the API. To find these values, simply open up your collection, and click the `API` button.
